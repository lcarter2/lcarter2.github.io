					<h4><strong>RPI Computer Science Department</strong> --- Undergraduate Teaching Assistant</h4> <h6><br><i>Troy, NY</i> (August 2022 - May 2023)</h6>

					<p>
						In my role as a Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, I was entrusted with leading weekly laboratory sessions, where I instilled essential Python programming principles to a diverse class of thirty students. These sessions, carefully structured to ensure both practical and theoretical learning, were critical in fostering their computational thinking abilities. To provide tailored support and address individual queries, I maintained flexible drop-in office hours. This not only assisted students with their homework and coursework but also facilitated a deeper understanding of the subject. Furthermore, I administered critical academic responsibilities, including grading exams and assignments, thus allowing me to monitor students' progress closely. I also diligently improved course materials, ensuring they were up-to-date and effective, which contributed to a more comprehensive learning environment.
